    Assembling a Package Item
  </h1>
  <br><br>
  Packages, like repositories, are made completely in JSON. For a more complete outline, look at <a href="https://github.com/xubiod/enigma/blob/master/test.package.json" target="_blank" style="font-weight: 600">test.package.json</a> provided on GitHub.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>"results"</strong> is the array that contains the entire package information in objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>"name"</strong> is the name of an item. <strong>"file"</strong> is what is displayed on the list.
  <br>
  <strong>"goto"</strong> is the link to download a file. <strong>"run"</strong> is the JavaScript that is run when something is clicked on. It is advised to leave the other blank when one is in use.
