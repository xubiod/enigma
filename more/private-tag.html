    Private Badge Handling
  </h1>
  <br>
  There is a "Private" tag, but nothing is done in the backend. This is a psuedo-guide on how to use it properly.
  <h2>Handling</h2>

  The way that private items are handled are dependent on the page loaded into the workspace, whether it's an IP address check or through OAuth methods. Please note that a non-OAuth method for usernames and passwords can be easy to crack.
